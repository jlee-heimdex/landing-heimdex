## 4) Problem Section

**Headline**

* Overwhelmed by
* growing video libraries?

**Cards**

1. Spending all day searching for videos?

   * Looking for one cut? You've opened three external drives.
   * You remember "the scene with the red shirt" but don't know where it is.
   * After scrolling through timelines dozens of times,
   * Finding becomes harder than editing.

2. You have the footage, but end up creating it again

   * Thousands of videos are stored on NAS and Google Drive.
   * But you don't know who shot it, when, or where, so you can't find it.
   * Eventually you shoot again, edit again, and upload again.
   * Videos become forgotten data instead of assets.

3. Can't find stolen content before it spreads?

   * Your videos are circulating on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
   * You don't know who uploaded them or when they spread.
   * By the time you try to search and stop it, thousands are already exposed.
   *
   * Until a fan notifies you,
   * our videos cannot protect themselves.
