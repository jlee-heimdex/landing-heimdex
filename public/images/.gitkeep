# Image Assets Directory

Store your image files in the appropriate subdirectories:

- `hero/` - Hero section images and main visuals
- `products/` - Product screenshots, demos, feature illustrations
- `company/` - Company/about page images
- `team/` - Team member photos
- `logos/` - Brand logos, partner logos, technology badges
- `og/` - OpenGraph social sharing images (1200x630px recommended)

## Usage

Import images in Next.js components using the `next/image` component:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/images/hero/your-image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  priority
/>
```

## Best Practices

- Use WebP format when possible for better compression
- Optimize images before committing (use ImageOptim, Squoosh, etc.)
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-screenshot.png`, not `img1.png`)
- Keep OpenGraph images at 1200x630px, < 1MB file size
